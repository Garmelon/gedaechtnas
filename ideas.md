# Ideas for GedächtNAS

This file is a collection of potentially fairly fine-grained ideas for future
GedächtNAS development, like a TODO list without commitment. Ideally, each idea
takes a short time to implement and represents an incremental improvement.

Once an idea has been implemented, it should be deleted from this file.
