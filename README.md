# GedächtNAS - external storage for your brain

## The name?

"Gedächtnis" is German for memory (brain), "NAS" stands for Network-Attached
Storage. The combination of the two is a bad pun that requires specialized
hardware to even type properly.

In places where the *proper name* — "GedächtNAS", including the umlaut and
capitalization — can't be used, the *technical name* — "gedaechtnas", always
lowercase — or the *abbreviated name* — "gdn" — shall be used instead. Other
variations or spellings are incorrect.
